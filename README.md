# PHP 2026-09-24 security releases tracking site

Source for the PHP 2026-09-24 patch-status tracker: a single-page site
recording which distributions have shipped the PHP security releases
of that day, branch by branch.

## Where the facts live

Everything about the releases — the advisories and CVEs they close,
the fixed version per PHP branch, and current per-distribution patch
status — belongs to the tracker page, not to this README:

- **Rendered:** <https://kimmo.cloud/php-20260924/>
- **Source:** [`site/content/_index.md`](site/content/_index.md)

Edit that file; everything else in this repo is build infrastructure.

None of it is restated here on purpose.  The tracker page is revised as
distributions ship fixes — for the actively updated trackers, twice
daily by the auto-update agent — so any copy kept in this README would
silently rot.  Resist re-adding a summary.

Deployment plan and current setup state live in
[`WEBSITE.md`](WEBSITE.md).

## Local development

Requires Hugo ≥ 0.146.0 (the standard edition suffices: no Sass or image
processing in this site) and Go (for Hugo Modules to fetch the PaperMod
theme).

### With Nix (recommended)

```sh
nix develop          # dev shell: hugo, go, resvg + fonts, and every lookup tool
cd site
hugo server          # local preview at http://localhost:1313/php-20260924/
```

If you use [direnv](https://direnv.net/), `direnv allow` once and the
dev shell auto-activates whenever you `cd` into the repo.

### Without Nix

Install Hugo ≥ 0.146.0 and Go ≥ 1.24 yourself (`CLAUDE.md` § "Build
environment" has the `go install` recipe), then:

```sh
cd site
hugo server          # http://localhost:1313/php-20260924/
```

## Build and publish

```sh
make build       # local build into site/public/
make dist        # build, then rsync to haig:/php-20260924/
make banner      # re-rasterise the social banner SVG → PNG (needs resvg + the banner fonts)
make check       # run the lookup-helper tests
```

`make dist` runs `make build` first. `make banner` is only needed after
editing `site/assets/php-20260924-tracker.svg`; the rendered PNG is
committed.

## Lookup helpers

PHP ships several branches at once, and a distribution's package
version does not say which upstream PHP release it builds. Three
helpers read that out of each ecosystem's own source — never by running
`php`:

```sh
./scripts/debian-versions
```

```sh
./scripts/pkgsrc-versions
```

```sh
./scripts/nixpkgs-versions
```

Each prints one tab-separated line per distribution release and PHP
branch: the package, the upstream PHP release it builds, whether it is
the release's default PHP, and any tracked advisory ids backported on
top. `debian-versions` reads the branch per suite from `php-defaults`
and the PHP release from the package changelog; `pkgsrc-versions`
reads `lang/php/phpversion.mk` in the local pkgsrc clone;
`nixpkgs-versions` reads the `phpXY` attributes at each channel's
revision in the local nixpkgs clone. `-h` explains each one's output
in full. The advisory ids they search for are listed in
`scripts/tracked-ids`.

## Dating a fix

A row's *Fixed since* is the date the fix actually shipped, derived
from the source that shipped it — never the day it was noticed. For the
NixOS and nixpkgs channels that derivation is a script:

```sh
./scripts/nixos-first-shipped nixos-unstable <nixpkgs-commit>
```

It lists the channel's published releases, finds the earliest one built
from a revision containing the commit, and prints that release and its
publication date. Debian dates come from the changelog or
snapshot.debian.org, pkgsrc dates from the history of
`lang/php/phpversion.mk`.
